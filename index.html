        <p>
            You lived 5 years without me and luckily I didn't have to live a single day without you by my side.
            We may have buttheads growing up and said we hated each other but that was the furthest thing from the truth.
            While everyone around me wanted to doctors, engineers I wanted to be like you.
            I have never loved or admired someone for begin themselves, you are the most selfless and dedicated person I know.
            You are so unbelievably strong, stronger than most of us and you get enough credited for it.
            From the moment I have tied that rakhi for the first time and till now, you have always held me high and I don't tell you how comforting it is to sore the sky knowing I will never fall down.
            To all the seasons that has passed, happy raksha Bandhan.
